I could imagine an architecture where a Workload receives a rotatable SVID from its runtime environment, and in order to talk with an resource server that requires API keys, presents that SVID for token exchange.  In this case, the IdP, as a security-centric application, must follow best practices for storage and retrieval of API Keys.  This architecture could help reduce the risk of compromise of the API key, when compared to direct per-workload API key injection via environment variables.",

Please describe.**\nThe current `on-demand` pattern doesn't really highlight the difference towards credential exchange which is in many ways \"on-demand\" too. There's also some overlap with initial provisioning as platforms often implement on-demand by combining initial provisioning with credential exchange (e.g. Github, Kubernetes)\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAfter discussion with Andrew we landed on a 4-level provisioning concept:\n\n- Manual\n- Platform initial\n- Platform on-demand\n- Credential exchange\n\nThis would make it more clear to the reader that initial & on-demand is within the platform, but credential exchange outside of the platform. Manual provisioning kind of covers situations where the platform doesn't support either.\n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\n",

          "body": "## Pull Request Overview\n\nThis PR refines the terminology around credential acquisition by splitting and renaming the initial and on-demand mechanisms, adding new definitions, and updating the recommendation tables accordingly.\n\n- Split \u201cInitial provisioning\u201d into \u201cInitial manual provisioning\u201d and \u201cInitial platform provisioning\u201d\n- Introduced \u201cOn-demand platform issuance\u201d alongside \u201cOn-demand credential exchange\u201d\n- Updated all recommendation tables to use the new mechanism names\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Comments suppressed due to low confidence (3)</summary>\n\n**draft-schwenkschuster-wimse-credential-exchange.md:104**\n* [nitpick] Consider rephrasing for clarity, e.g.: `Compared to on-demand platform issuance, this mechanism typically occurs outside the platform and requires authentication.`\n```\n: Workloads use an existing credential (provisioned manually or by the platform) to authenticate and authorize a request for a different credential. Based on parameters, the workload can specify the exact attributes of the credential it requires. The significant difference towards the on-demand platform issuance is that this is not necessarily within the platform and often an **authenticated** action.\n```\n**draft-schwenkschuster-wimse-credential-exchange.md:100**\n* [nitpick] To keep terminology consistent, consider using `provisioning` instead of `issuance` (e.g., `On-demand platform provisioning`).\n```\nOn-demand platform issuance\n```\n**draft-schwenkschuster-wimse-credential-exchange.md:94**\n* List items for the new mechanisms are missing the leading hyphen (`- `), which breaks the markdown list. Add `- ` before each mechanism title.\n```\nInitial manual provisioning\n```\n</details>\n\n",

Parameters allow the workload to specify exactly the required format, scope, identity, lifetime, and other attributes the workload requires. No authentication is necessary to request on-demand credentials. The platform is able to strongly identify the workload so this request is typically unauthenticated from the workload's point of view. Implementations may use the workload's initial provisioned credential in the background to authenticate the request, but this is not visible to the workload.\n```",
