The focus and environment of this document is clearly authentication but workloads may also require credentials for other purposes such as encryption.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWe should be clear about the scope here.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nWe can either include all sorts or limit it to authentication.\n\n**Additional context**\nIn the `Change of scope` section the following example is given that indicate encryption:\n\n> An X.509 credential is constrained to a certain key usage but the workload requires additional ones. For instance the existing certificate allows for digitalSignature but keyEncipherment or dataEncipherment is required.",
