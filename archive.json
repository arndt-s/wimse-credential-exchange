I could imagine an architecture where a Workload receives a rotatable SVID from its runtime environment, and in order to talk with an resource server that requires API keys, presents that SVID for token exchange.  In this case, the IdP, as a security-centric application, must follow best practices for storage and retrieval of API Keys.  This architecture could help reduce the risk of compromise of the API key, when compared to direct per-workload API key injection via environment variables.",
